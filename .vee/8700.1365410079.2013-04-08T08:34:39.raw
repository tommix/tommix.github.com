Running vee on Android

Well, cheatng slightly; I'm using a union mounted Debian image to run a full environment; of
course vee works just fine here. This environment gets me command-line git so I can update
the final website; I'll have to look at the options for native git (not in busybox!) and
see if I can improve the workflow further!
